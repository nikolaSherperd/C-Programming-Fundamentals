# 01 Basics

The best way to learn a new programming language is by writing codes/programs in it.
It has been a culture now, to write the "Hello, World!" program for all languages.
For the basics you would be writing your first c program (A program that prints 
"Hello, world!" to the console) shortly...

Next would be a program that converts Farenheit to Celsius and vice versa, for a better understanding of
**Variables and Arithmetic Expressions.**


**Objective:** Understand the structure of a C program, the compilation process (GCC), and basic output.

## File Manifest
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hello.c` | Standard Hello World program. |
| `f2c.c` | Fahrenheit to Celsius (Variable basics). |
| `the for statement, symbolic constants, char input and output etc.` | Exploring `<limits.h>` constants. |

## 🧠 Key Concepts
* **Compilation:** Preprocessing -> Compiling -> Assembly -> Linking.
* **Main Function:** `int main(void)` is the entry point.
* **Return Values:** `return 0` implies success; non-zero implies error.
* **Comments:** `//` for single line, `/* ... */` for blocks.

## 📝 Notes
* **Command:** `gcc -o prog_name source.c`
